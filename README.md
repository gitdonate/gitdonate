# GitDonate

The goal of GitDonate is to provide a way for open-source developers to receive donations through cryptocurrency. Rather then just
place the public address of single ethereum or bitcoin wallet the project maintainers can reference a deployed GitDonate contract.
GitDonate will handle distributing the donations to all the developers of the project and not just the original creator. 
This is useful for open-source projects that want to have more then 1 developer working on the project. It will help attract
other developers to commit to this open-source project if they know they might recieve some of the donations for their work.
